Stuff like signing if you leave the room, signing before and after you finish the test, have specific papers in specific bags, it was a mess. Even though all that in the end everything went smooth and as planned.The Bulgarian &amp;amp; Literature exam was, well as hard as expected. I prepared hard for the grammar part so I blazed through it. The literature part was also a bit easier due to prepartaion but still challenging and then the final essay was.. pain to put it simply. That essay alone was what made the whole exam difficult. In the end I scored a 54.50 which is a score I expected. Nothing surprising, I am satisfied with it.The English exam was very easy. Only after the grading did I realise that maybe I was the only one who had it easy? I heard they were audio problems at the listening. No clue… The audio was perfectly clear. The reading was a bit challenging but nothing impossible. Lastly the writing consisted of a letter and an essay. Again nothing too hard. I ended that exam with a 87.50 which I think is a fantastic score.Also today I received my Microsoft Structured Query Language certificate from Software University making it my seventh certificate! I learned a lot of topics for only a month (joins, aggregation, functions, stored procedures, querying, CRUD operations, the ACID convention etc.) and I feel confident in my relational database knowledge. Tomorrow I’ll take my next step in my journey - The Entity Framework Core connecting my C# knowledge with my relational database knowledge.On the other hand my job is also going amazingly. Last time I wrote I was only barely a month in but now I am almost 3 months in and I really do love my job. The quality assurance course is at its final stages and creating it was not only fun but it gave me much more experience than before. I cannot wait for my next course assignment, I wonder what will it be?P.S. Check out the SQL code I wrote throughout the course if you’re interested!" }, { "title": "April / May Update", "url": "/posts/April-May-Update/", "categories": "Updates", "tags": "misc", "date": "2022-05-10 19:17:00 +0300", "snippet": "Hello Everyone!In this post I wanna talk about myself a little and say some stuff that happened in April and now in May.First of all I want to say, no I have not forgotten about my jekyll site but I am far away from thewriter type so I really just post whenever I feel like I have something to say and now I do have somethings to say.First of all I am now a member of Software University Svetlina as a Curriculum Specialist! For those who do not know Softuni Svetlina is a high-school for programming, graphic design and marketing, made by the Software University Organization. I was contacted by Softuni Svetlinas founder Svetlin Nakov on the 25th of March. In all honesty I was certain “They got the wrong guy!”, “Why would they contact me for work?”. After some minutes of doubt but excitment at the same timeI answered back with an introduction to myself and after some emails back and forth I agreed to their work terms.Then I was awaiting a phone interview. “Me? A phone interview? This is really happening isn’t it?” is all it was in my head. Well the phone interview happened and it went… pretty well and not as bad as I thought. On the 1st of April I was now on the team, and no, it was not a first of april joke! :smiley:My first meeting was right after a few days on the 6th of April where me, my now supervisor and Nakov himself introduced me to what the team is doing and what I will be doing in the following months.I was assigned as the leader of the Quality Assurance Course with this huge team to lead of a whole whapping count of… one member… yes.. Only me, it was only me, one man army, responsible for making this course from the ground up with a deadline until September. “Only me? Can I do this on my own?”.Well let us fast forward to April 30th and find out shall we? zooooooom.. I am so sorry.April is now over and I have now been on the team for a month! :tada:With a total count of 51 hours for the month I got my first salary, which yes it does feel well to earn money on your own, and I was now accustomed to the process. I had a total of 12 topics to make until September with the cycle being simple. Every topic needs a presentation, exercises and solutions only for the teachers. Rarely must I start a resource from scratch, even though that has happened, instead I take already existing resources from Softunis QA courses and edit them (heavily) until my supervisor gives the :thumbsup:.As of writing this, the 10th of May, my 12th grade matriculations are next week and I do feel a bit anxious, but I am sure everything will go smooth. Next week I will also take my next step in my programming journey - Microsoft Structured Query Language. I am very excited to study databases!That is everything that has happened in April and May for me!
