Hello World!

My name is Denis Vasilev, a chilled laid-back guy who aspires to be a software engineer, and welcome...

To my own personal page. :tada:

Here I will be mainly posting announcements about my projects on github [which you should totally follow cause it is totally awesome][vass-github]. I don't really see this as a "serious blog" more like a casual place for me and the people who follow me to follow my journey as a person and as a developer. 

So welcome - and enjoy your stay!
