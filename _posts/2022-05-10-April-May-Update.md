Hello Everyone!

In this post I wanna talk about myself a little and say some stuff that happened in April and now in May.
First of all I want to say, no I have not forgotten about my jekyll site but I am far away from the
writer type so I really just post whenever I feel like I have something to say and now I do have some
things to say. 

First of all I am now a member of [Software University Svetlina][softuni-svetlina] as a *Curriculum Specialist!* For those who do not know Softuni Svetlina is a high-school for programming, graphic design and marketing, made by the 
[Software University Organization][softuni-org]. I was contacted by Softuni Svetlinas founder [Svetlin Nakov][nakov-linkedin] on the 25th of March. In all honesty I was certain *"They got the wrong guy!"*, 
*"Why would they contact **me** for work?"*. After some minutes of doubt but excitment at the same time
I answered back with an introduction to myself and after some emails back and forth I agreed to their work terms. 

Then I was awaiting a phone interview. *"Me? A phone interview? This is really happening isn't it?"* is all it was in my head. Well the phone interview happened and it went... pretty well and not as bad as I thought. On the 1st of April I was now on the team, and no, it was not a first of april joke! :smiley:
My first meeting was right after a few days on the 6th of April where me, my now supervisor and Nakov himself introduced me to what the team is doing and what ***I*** will be doing in the following months.
I was assigned as the leader of the *Quality Assurance Course* with this huge team to lead of a whole whapping count of... one member... yes.. Only me, it was only me, one man army, responsible for making this course from the ground up with a deadline until September. *"Only me? Can I do this on my own?"*.
Well let us fast forward to April 30th and find out shall we? *zooooooom*.. ~~I am so sorry~~.

April is now over and I have now been on the team for a month! :tada: 

With a total count of 51 hours for the month I got my first salary, which yes it does feel well to earn money on your own, and I was now accustomed to the process. I had a total of 12 topics to make until September with the cycle being simple. Every topic needs a presentation, exercises and solutions only for the teachers. Rarely must I start a resource from scratch, even though that has happened, instead I take already existing resources from Softunis QA courses and edit them (heavily) until my supervisor gives the :thumbsup:.

As of writing this, the 10th of May, my 12th grade matriculations are next week and I do feel a bit anxious, but I am sure everything will go smooth. Next week I will also take my next step in my programming journey - Microsoft Structured Query Language. I am very excited to study databases! 

That is everything that has happened in April and May for me! Thank you for reading and have an amazing day you awesome person!
