Hello Everyone!

In this post I wanna talk about the month of June and update everyone what has happened since my last post at the 10th of May.

As you could possibly remember last time I typed to you reader I mentioned my State Matriculation Exams and how I was preparing to attend them only eight days after the post.

These exams were a bit nerve wrecking honestly, the whole setup was overcomplicated. Stuff like signing if you leave the room, signing before and after you finish the test, have specific papers in specific bags, it was a mess. Even though all that in the end everything went smooth and as planned.

The Bulgarian & Literature exam was, well as hard as expected. I prepared hard for the grammar part so I blazed through it. The literature part was also a bit easier due to prepartaion but still challenging and then the final essay was.. pain to put it simply. That essay alone was what made the whole exam difficult. In the end I scored a 54.50 which is a score I expected. Nothing surprising, I am satisfied with it.

The English exam was very easy. Only after the grading did I realise that maybe I was the only one who had it easy? I heard they were audio problems at the listening. No clue... The audio was perfectly clear. The reading was a bit challenging but nothing impossible. Lastly the writing consisted of a letter and an essay. Again nothing too hard. I ended that exam with a 87.50 which I think is a fantastic score.

Also today I received my [Microsoft Structured Query Language certificate][mssql-cert] from Software University making it my seventh certificate! I learned a lot of topics for only a month (joins, aggregation, functions, stored procedures, querying, CRUD operations, the ACID convention etc.) and I feel confident in my relational database knowledge. Tomorrow I'll take my next step in my journey - The Entity Framework Core connecting my C# knowledge with my relational database knowledge. 

On the other hand my job is also going amazingly. Last time I wrote I was only barely a month in but now I am almost 3 months in and I really do love my job. The quality assurance course is at its final stages and creating it was not only fun but it gave me much more experience than before. I cannot wait for my next course assignment, I wonder what will it be?

P.S. Check out the [SQL code I wrote][mssql-code] throughout the course if you're interested!
